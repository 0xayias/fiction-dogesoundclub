# Doge Sound Club (Fiction)
This is where characters and worldview settings are organized.
There isn't much yet, so I'll list them all in this single file.

DESCRIPTIONS
- Mate (Character Type)
: indigenous people of the earth. It consists of a man, woman, rabbit, monkey, tiger and robot.
Mates have the idea that the real world is fake and everything is a simulation. 
To prove that the world is a simulation, intentionally doing nonsensical jokes or behaviors that trigger a bug in the simulation. 
Mate often drinks beer that they don't even drink well to do high-level jokes.


- e-Mate  (Character Type)
: An alien from another dimension called AYIAS.
Crash landed on Earth due to abnormal dimension movement portal operation.
e-Mate have very high intelligence.
e-Mate can open a dimension shift portal.
e-Mate's intelligence is so high that e-Mate can't talk nonsensical jokes and weird behaviors that e-Mate cannot cause simulation bugs unlike mate.


- Chronium (Character Type)
: Guardian of Simulation.
Chronium hate Mates that keep triggering simulation bugs.


- Bias  (Character Type)
: Mates woke up after 100 years after falling asleep due to Chronium's trick.

- MIX (Currency)
: e-Mates can create dimension shifting portals, but in order to activate them, a bug must occur at the point of operation, causing cracks in the simulation. However, the e-Mates could not cause bugs, and they asked the Mates for a year of continuous nonsencial jokes and weird behaviors so that the bugs could occur. Instead, e-Mates will give Mates a mix coin, but it is worthless now, but they will come back and exchange it for 1g of gold per mix coin. Mix Cat, the leader of the e-Mates, has his face engraved on the Mix Coin, saying he will keep his promise. 21 million mix coins were produced at this time.
