e-Mate's intelligence is so high that e-Mate can't talk nonsensical jokes and weird behaviors that e-Mate cannot cause simulation bugs unlike mate.


- Chronium (Character Type)

Chronium hate Mates that keep triggering simulation bugs.


- Bias  (Character Type)
: Mates woke up after 100 years after falling asleep due to Chronium's trick.

- MIX (Currency)
:e-Mates can create dimension shifting portals, but in order to activate them, a bug must occur causing cracks in the simulation. However, the e-Mates cannot say jokes to cause bugs so they asked the Mates for a year of continuous nonsencial jokes for the bugs. 
If then, e-Mates says, will give Mates a mix coin which is worthless as of now but they will come back later and exchange it for 1g of gold per mix coin. Mix Cat, the leader of the e-Mates, has his face engraved on the Mix Coin, saying he will keep his promise. 21 million mix coins were produced at this time.
